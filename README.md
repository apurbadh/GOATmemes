## Introduction

Social Networking - It's the way the 21st century communicates now. Social networking is the grouping of individuals into specific groups, like small rural communities or a neighborhood subdivision. Although social networking is possible in person, especially in the workplace, universities, and high schools, it is most popular online. This is because unlike most high schools, colleges, or workplaces, the internet is filled with millions of individuals who are looking to meet other people. Social network is the mapping and measuring of relationships and flows between people, groups, organizations, computers, URLs, and other connected information/knowledge entities. The nodes in the network are the people and groups while the links show relationships or flows between the nodes. Social network provides both a visual and a mathematical analysis of human relationships.

Memes are not a new concept. Every fashion trend, each new slang term, anything that influenced or reformed a person or a group because of the sheer fact that it was “popular” is a meme. Coined by Richard Dawkins from DNA research and the word “memetics”, memes are behaviors, ideas, or styles in popular culture that spread from person to person. However, this spread of pop culture has taken on a new medium, the Internet. Now, instead of spreading ideas, concepts, and behaviors through television, printed media, or word of mouth, we use websites. We make videos. We compose graphics. We have upgraded our environment to that of the technological world, and have consequently proceeded to reproduce our culture there.


## Why GOATmemes?

GOATmemes is the platform to connect people through memes. Due to their obvious popularity, and seeming permanence, memes are now a subject studied at a social level. The way they influence thought, are influenced by current events and popular culture, shape speech, and entertain mass audiences has proved that memes have a significant societal impact, especially among the lives and culture of the young.These memes also create a new place for advertisers to generate interest in their products, giving memes yet another reason to stick around in the future.


## Challenges while making GOATmemes.

Time was the greatest hurdle we were facing from the starting of the hackathon. But at last, we are really proud of what we came up with within these 24 hours. Most of the bugs were regarding the development of some features of back-end in our media using Django. But we managed to solve these kind of problems using different online forums and articles like Medium, StackOverflow, etc.
